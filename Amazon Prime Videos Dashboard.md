## Recommendations


﻿Ratings Distribution:
 
Per the visualization, people prefer shows rated 13+ the most. With over 2,100 shows in that category, it’s clear that content for teens and older viewers is popular. The 16+ and ALL ratings also have a decent following, so it’s a good idea to keep offering content for these age groups. Since there’s a wide range of ratings (from 1 to 2,117), it's worth thinking about how to target different groups with specific types of content that match their age and preferences.

Genres Distribution:

Drama is by far the most popular genre, a continous growth in drama contents will yield more views. Comedy and suspense are also doing well, so it would be smart to create more shows in these genres too.  Since Drama is the top genre, consider expanding on that, but also try mixing genres. For example, creating a drama-comedy, or drama-action hybrid could attract more viewers.

Geographical Distribution:

The USA has the most shows, but there are other countries like India, the UK, and Canada where people are also watching a lot of content. Think about tailoring content to these countries to match their tastes. Countries like France, Germany, and Italy are growing markets, so adding more content that fits their preferences could really help increase viewership there.

Content Type (TV vs. Movies):

Movies are much more popular than TV shows, so it’s a good idea to keep focusing on movies. That said, adding a few more TV shows to the mix wouldn’t hurt since there are still people who enjoy them. Even though movies are taking the lead right now, it’s good to keep an eye on TV shows as they might come back in popularity. Offering a good balance between movies and TV could help attract a wider audience.

Release Trends:

From 1920 to 2021, movies were more popular, and in 2021, they really took off. This shows a shift in what people want to watch, so it might bea good idea to focus on movie releases for the next couple of years. Stay on top of trends and keep adjusting content to what people are watching most right now. It’s also helpful to prepare for future shifts in viewing habits.

Total Shows per Country and Genre:

The USA has the highest number of shows, and action is the most popular genre. So, it will be advisable to keep investing in action content for countries like the USA, India, and the UK. It’s also worth creating more localized content for countries like France, Germany, and Italy, where action and Drama are popular. Customizing content to these regions could help attract more viewers.

Action Genre is a Global Phenomenon:

Since action is popular everywhere, it’s a good idea to keep focusing on it. But you could also experiment with combining it with other genres like Comedy or Adventure to make it even more exciting for different types of viewers. Collaborating with well-known action franchises or creators could bring in more viewers who love that genre. Exclusive Action shows could become a big draw.
