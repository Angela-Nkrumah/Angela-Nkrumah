 ### Insights
    
 Across all designations, the total of employees ranged from 43 to 60. With an overall count of employees at 306.
 At a total number of 60, drivers had the highest employees and was 39.53% higher than clerks, which had the lowest number of employees at 43. Drivers account for 19.61% of the total 
 employees. Which suggest that drivers are extremely essential to the company's operations and require frequent target management to ensure their effectiveness.
 The hiring score of 0 accounted for the highest number of employees at 46.08%, followed by hiring quality of 1 at 29.41% with hiring quality number of 2 following at 15.03%.
 The company has a total of 27 employees in their 20's followed by the rest of the employees being in their 30's which shows a good range of young minds and experienced workers but will 
 need to employ more young minds to ensure the longevity of the organization.
 With a total count of 86 employees at Washington, it appears to be the place of residence for most employees followed by Los Angeles, New York and London which had the lowest count of 
 employees at 60. 
 At 86, Washington had the highest number of employees and was 43.33% higher than London, which had the lowest number of employees at 60. Washington could be leveraged for further 
 development of the organization due to its concentration of employees.
 73.2% of the total number of employees present on the data seem to have retired which leaves 23.1% of the total number of employees still present at the company. Looking at the present 
 state of the company, a total of 6 new employees need to be employed and 3 in the near future.
 Within the time period the data was collected, 101 employees were freshly hired, adding up to the 205(66.99%) of existing workers.
 82 employees seem to have left the company for no reason with 54 employees leaving the company without given any specific reason. 49 employees left the company due to better 
 opportunities elsewhere, with 44 employees being fired and 42 retiring.
 While 35 employees left the company due to natural causes. The number of employees leaving for better opportunities signify the need for better retention services.
 The insights suggest a stable but aging workforce which needs fresh hires and a better retention service to ensure the longevity and growth of the organization.


 ### Recommendations
     
 - Optimize Employee Retention
 
 - Investigate why so many employees (82) left without a clear reason and address any underlying concerns. Create an exit interview process to understand why employees leave, especially 
 those seeking better opportunities (49 employees). Enhance workplace benefits and career growth opportunities to reduce turnover.

 - Focus on Workforce Planning
 
 With 73.2% of employees retired, prioritize hiring to fill immediate gaps. Employ 6 new hires now and plan for 3 more soon to sustain operations. Explore hiring younger talent to 
 maintain a balanced age demographic, ensuring a mix of experience and innovation.

 - Leverage Washington's Strength
   
 Washington, with the highest number of employees (86), appears to be a hub. Consider expanding operations or recruitment efforts in this area for its existing workforce potential.
 
 - Improve Hiring Quality

 Address the hiring quality gap, as 46.08% of employees are rated at the lowest hiring score (0). Revamp the hiring process to focus on attracting skilled and high-quality candidates, 
 potentially by refining job descriptions or targeting more qualified talent pools.
 
- Strengthen Clerk Recruitment
  
 Clerks, with the lowest count of employees (43), might indicate a role requiring extra attention. Evaluate if the workload is manageable or if additional hiring is needed.

 - Targeted Engagement Programs
 - 
 Drivers, being the largest group (19.61%), could benefit from specific engagement programs to boost morale and productivity, ensuring their retention.

 - Diversify Locations
   
 Balance employee distribution across locations to reduce dependency on Washington and strengthen representation in cities like London, which has the lowest count (60).

 - Create a Succession Plan
   
 With a significant percentage of employees in their 30s, develop a succession planning strategy to ensure smooth transitions as the workforce ages.

 - Communicate Growth Opportunities
   
 Promote internal mobility to retain talent. Employees might leave for better opportunities because of unclear growth paths within the company.

 - Enhance Data Tracking
   
 Use better data tracking systems to monitor employee performance, retention, and satisfaction, ensuring continuous improvement in HR strategies.


## Summary
    
 The company has a stable workforce but faces challenges like high employee turnover and a need for better retention strategies. Drivers are the largest group, clerks the smallest, and 
 Washington is a key location. With many employees retiring, hiring new talent, especially younger workers, is crucial. Improving hiring quality and understanding why employees leave can 
 help strengthen the company for the future.
